An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",\"loc\":{\"lines\":{\"from\":176,\"to\":181}}}},{\"pageContent\":\"Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",\"loc\":{\"lines\":{\"from\":182,\"to\":184}}}},{\"pageContent\":\"Agent System Overview\\n                \\n                    Component One: Planning\\n                        \\n                \\n                    Task Decomposition\\n                \\n                    Self-Reflection\\n                \\n                \\n                    Component Two: Memory\\n                        \\n                \\n                    Types of Memory\\n                \\n                    Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)\\n                \\n                \\n                    Component Three: Tool Use\\n                \\n                    Case Studies\\n                        \\n                \\n                    Scientific Discovery Agent\\n                \\n                    Generative Agents Simulation\\n                \\n                    Proof-of-Concept Examples\\n                \\n                \\n                    Challenges\\n                \\n                    Citation\\n                \\n                    References\",\"metadata\":{\"source\":\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",\"loc\":{\"lines\":{\"from\":112,\"to\":146}}}},{\"pageContent\":\"(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results.
