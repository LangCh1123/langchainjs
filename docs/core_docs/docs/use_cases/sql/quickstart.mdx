# Quickstart

In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A chain and agent over a SQL database.
These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a SQL database and get back a natural language answer.
The main difference between the two is that our agent can query the database in a loop as many time as it needs to answer the question.

## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️

Building Q&A systems of SQL databases can require executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this.
Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs.
This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, see [here](/docs/security).

## Architecture

At a high-level, the steps of most SQL chain and agent are:

1. **Convert question to SQL query**: Model converts user input to a SQL query.
2. **Execute SQL query**: Execute the SQL query
3. **Answer the question**: Model responds to user input using the query results.

## Setup

First, get required packages and set environment variables:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
yarn add langchain @langchain/community @langchain/openai
```

We default to OpenAI models in this guide.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>

# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required, but recommended for debugging and observability.
# export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your key>
# export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
```
