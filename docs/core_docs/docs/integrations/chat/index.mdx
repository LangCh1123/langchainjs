# Chat models

## Features (natively supported)

All [Chat models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models) come with default implementations of all methods, ie. `invoke`, `batch`, `stream`. This gives all chat models basic support for invoking, streaming and batching, which by default is implemented as below:

- _Streaming_ support defaults to returning an `AsyncIterator` of a single value, the final result returned by the underlying model provider. Note that this doesn't give you token-by-token streaming, which requires native support from the model provider, but ensures your code that expects an iterator of tokens can work for any of our model integrations.
- _Batch_ support defaults to calling the underlying model in parallel for each input. You can control the concurrency with a `maxConcurrency` runtime param.

Additionally, some chat models support additional ways of guaranteeing structure in their outputs by allowing you to pass in a defined schema.
[Tool calling](/docs/how_to/tool_calling) (tool calling) is one capability, and allows you to use the chat model as the LLM in certain types of agents.
Some models in LangChain have also implemented a `withStructuredOutput()` method that unifies many of these different ways of constraining output to a schema.

The table shows, for each integration, which features have been implemented with native support. Yellow circles (🟡) indicates partial support - for example, if the model supports tool calling but not tool messages for agents.
