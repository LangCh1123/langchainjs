# PGVector

To enable vector search in a generic PostgreSQL database, LangChain.js supports using the [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) Postgres extension.

## Setup

To work with PGVector, you need to install the `pg` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install pg
```

### Setup a `pgvector` self hosted instance with `docker-compose`

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community
```

`pgvector` provides a prebuilt Docker image that can be used to quickly setup a self-hosted Postgres instance.
Create a file below named `docker-compose.yml`:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DockerExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/pgvector_vectorstore/docker-compose.example.yml";

```yml
# Run this command to start the database:
# docker-compose up --build
version: "3"
services:
  db:
    hostname: 127.0.0.1
    image: ankane/pgvector
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=api
      - POSTGRES_USER=myuser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ChangeMe
    volumes:
      - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
```

And then in the same directory, run `docker compose up` to start the container.

You can find more information on how to setup `pgvector` in the [official repository](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

## Usage

::::danger Security
User-generated data such as usernames should not be used as input for table and column names.  
**This may lead to SQL Injection!**
::::

import Example from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/pgvector_vectorstore/pgvector.ts";

One complete example of using `PGVectorStore` is the following:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

You can also specify a `collectionTableName` and a `collectionName` to partition vectors between multiple users or namespaces.

### Advanced: reusing connections

You can reuse connections by creating a pool, then creating new `PGVectorStore` instances directly via the constructor.

Note that you should call `.initialize()` to set up your database at least once to set up your tables properly
before using the constructor.

import ConnectionReuseExample from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/pgvector_vectorstore/pgvector_pool.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ConnectionReuseExample}</CodeBlock>

### Create HNSW Index

By default, the extension performs a sequential scan search, with 100% recall. You might consider creating an HNSW index for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to speed up similaritySearchVectorWithScore execution time. To create the HNSW index on your vector column, use the `createHnswIndex()` method:

The optional method parameters include:

**dims**: Defines the number of dimensions in your vector data, max: 2000. For example, use 1536 for OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model and 1024 for amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0

**m**: The max number of connections per layer (16 by default)

**efConstruction**: The size of the dynamic candidate list for constructing the graph (64 by default)

**distanceFunction**: The distance function name you want to use, is automatically selected based on the distanceStrategy.
