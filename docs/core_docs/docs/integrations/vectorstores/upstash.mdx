# Upstash Vector

Upstash Vector is a REST based serverless vector database, designed for working with vector embeddings.

## Setup

1. Install Upstash Vector SDK.

We use OpenAI for the embeddings of the below snippets.
However, you can also create the embeddings using the model of your choice, that is available in the LangChain.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @langchain/openai
```

## Index and Query Documents

You can index the LangChain documents with any model of your choice, and perform a search over these documents.
