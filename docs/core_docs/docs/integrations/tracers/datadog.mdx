With [Datadog LLM Observability](https://docs.datadoghq.com/llm_observability/), you can monitor, troubleshoot, and evaluate your LLM-powered applications, such as chatbots. You can investigate the root cause of issues, monitor operational performance, and evaluate the quality, privacy, and safety of your LLM applications.
