# Firecrawl

This guide shows how to use [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) with LangChain to load web data into an LLM-ready format using Firecrawl.

## Overview

[FireCrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) crawls and convert any website into LLM-ready data. It crawls all accessible subpages and give you clean markdown and metadata for each. No sitemap required.

FireCrawl handles complex tasks such as reverse proxies, caching, rate limits, and content blocked by JavaScript. Built by the [mendable.ai](https://mendable.ai) team.

This guide shows how to scrap and crawl entire websites and load them using the `FireCrawlLoader` in LangChain.

## Setup

You'll need to sign up and retrieve your [FireCrawl API key](https://firecrawl.dev).

## Installation

You will need to install the `@mendableai/firecrawl-js` package:

```bash
npm install @mendableai/firecrawl-js
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `FireCrawlLoader` to load web search results:

Firecrawl offers 2 modes: `scrape` and `crawl`. In `scrape` mode, Firecrawl will only scrape the page you provide. In `crawl` mode, Firecrawl will crawl the entire website.

```typescript
import { FireCrawlLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/firecrawl";

const loader = new FireCrawlLoader({
    url: "https://firecrawl.dev",
    apiKey: process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY,
    mode: "scrape",
    params: {
        // optional parameters based on Firecrawl API docs
    }
  });

const docs = await loader.load();
```


### Additional Parameters

For `params` you can pass any of the params according to the [Firecrawl documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev).
