# Connery Toolkit

## What is Connery?

Connery is an open-source plugin infrastructure for AI.

With Connery, you can easily create a custom plugin with a set of actions and seamlessly integrate them into your LangChain agents and chains. Connery will handle the rest: runtime, authorization, secret management, access management, audit logs, and other vital features.
Additionally, Connery and our community offer a wide range of ready-to-use open-source plugins for your convenience.

## Prerequisites

To use Connery Actions in your LangChain agents, you need to do some preparation:

1. Set up the Connery runner using the [Quickstart](https://docs.connery.io/docs/platform/quick-start/) guide.
2. Install the [Summarization](https://github.com/connery-io/summarization-plugin) and [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugins on the runner.
3. Set environment variables `CONNERY_RUNNER_URL` and `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` so that the toolkit can communicate with the Connery Runner.

## Example

In the example below, we create an agent that uses two Connery Actions to summarize a public webpage and send the summary by email:

1. **Summarize public webpage** from the [Summarization](https://github.com/connery-io/summarization-plugin) plugin.
2. **Send email** from the [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Execution result

As a result of the execution, you will receive an email similar to the following:

**Subject**: Summary of "Life is Short"

**Body**: Here is a summary of the webpage "Life is Short" by Paul Graham:
The author reflects on the shortness of life and how having children has made them realize
the limited time they have. They argue that life is too short for unnecessary things,
or "bullshit," and that one should prioritize avoiding it.
They also discuss the importance of actively seeking out things that matter and not waiting to do them.
The author suggests pruning unnecessary things, savoring the time one has, and not waiting to do what truly matters.
They also discuss the effect of how one lives on the length of their life and the importance of being conscious of time.
