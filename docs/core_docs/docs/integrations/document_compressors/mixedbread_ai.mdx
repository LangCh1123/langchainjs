# Mixedbread ai reranking

## Overview

This guide will help you integrate and use the mixedbread ai reranking API. The reranking API allows you to reorder a list of documents based on a given query, improving the relevance of search results or any ranked list.

## Installation

To get started, install the `@langchain/mixedbread-ai` package along with the main LangChain package:

```bash
npm install @langchain/mixedbread-ai
```

## Authentication

Obtain your API key by signing up at [mixedbread ai](https://mixedbread.ai/). You can then set the `MXBAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your mixedbread ai API key or pass it directly as the `apiKey` option when constructing the class.

## Using Reranking

The `MixedbreadAIReranker` class provides access to the reranking API. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

1. **Import the Class**: First, import the `MixedbreadAIReranker` class from the package.

    ```typescript
    import { MixedbreadAIReranker } from '@langchain/mixedbread-ai';
    ```

2. **Instantiate the Class**: Create an instance of `MixedbreadAIReranker` with your API key.

    ```typescript
    const reranker = new MixedbreadAIReranker({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
    ```

3. **Rerank Documents**: Use the `rerankDocuments` method to reorder documents based on a query.

    ```typescript
    const documents = [
        { pageContent: "To bake bread you need flour" },
        { pageContent: "To bake bread you need yeast" },
        { pageContent: "To eat bread you need nothing but good taste" }
    ];
    const query = "What do you need to bake bread?";
    const result = await reranker.compressDocuments(documents, query);
    console.log(result);
    ```
