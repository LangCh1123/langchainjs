# Cohere Rerank

Reranking documents can greatly improve any RAG application and document retrieval system.

At a high level, a rerank API is a language model which analyzes the documents retrieved by the search engine and reorders them based on their relevance to the query.

Cohere offers an API for reranking documents. In this example we'll show you how to use it.


## Setup

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/cohere
```

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/document_compressors/cohere_rerank.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

From the results, we can see it returned the top 3 documents, and assigned a `relevanceScore` to each.

As expected, the document with the highest `relevanceScore` is the one that references Washington, D.C., with a score of `98.7%`!
