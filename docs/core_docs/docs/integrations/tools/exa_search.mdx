# Exa Search

Exa (formerly Metaphor Search) is a search engine fully designed for use by LLMs. Search for documents on the internet using natural language queries, then retrieve cleaned HTML content from desired documents.

Unlike keyword-based search (Google), Exa's neural search capabilities allow it to semantically understand queries and return relevant documents.
For example, we could search `"fascinating article about cats"` and compare the search results from Google and Exa.
Google gives us SEO-optimized listicles based on the keyword “fascinating”. Exa just works.

This notebook goes over how to use Exa Search with LangChain.

First, get an Exa API key and add it as an environment variable.

## Usage

First, install the LangChain integration package for Exa:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/exa @langchain/openai langchain
```

You'll need to set your API key as an environment variable.

The `Exa` class defaults to `EXASEARCH_API_KEY` when searching for your API key.

## Usage

import ToolExample from "@examples/tools/exa_search.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ToolExample}</CodeBlock>

## Using the Exa SDK as LangChain Agent Tools

We can create LangChain tools which use the Exa SDK to perform queries and retrieve content.
Using these tools we can construct a simple search agent that can answer questions about any topic.

import AgentExample from "@examples/tools/exa_agent.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AgentExample}</CodeBlock>
