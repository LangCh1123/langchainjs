# Tools and Toolkits

import { CategoryTable, IndexTable } from "@theme/FeatureTables";

[Tools](/docs/concepts/#tools) are utilities designed to be called by a model: their inputs are designed to be generated by models, and their outputs are designed to be passed back to models.

A [toolkit](/docs/concepts#toolkits) is a collection of tools meant to be used together. For a list of toolkit integrations, see [this page](/docs/integrations/toolkits/).
