## What is Connery?

Connery is an open-source plugin infrastructure for AI.

With Connery, you can easily create a custom plugin with a set of actions and seamlessly integrate them into your LangChain agents and chains.
Connery will handle the rest: runtime, authorization, secret management, access management, audit logs, and other vital features.
Additionally, Connery and our community offer a wide range of ready-to-use open-source plugins for your convenience.

## Prerequisites

To use Connery Actions in your LangChain agents, you need to do some preparation:

1. Set up the Connery runner using the [Quickstart](https://docs.connery.io/docs/platform/quick-start/) guide.
2. Install all the plugins with the actions you want to use in your agent.
3. Set environment variables `CONNERY_RUNNER_URL` and `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` so the toolkit can communicate with the Connery Runner.

## Example

In the example below, we fetch action by its ID from the Connery Runner and then call it with the specified parameters.
We use the ID of the **Send email** action from the [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.
You can find action IDs in the Connery Runner.
