## What is Connery?

Connery is an open-source plugin infrastructure for AI.

With Connery, you can easily create a custom plugin with a set of actions and seamlessly integrate them into your LangChain agent.
Connery will take care of critical aspects such as runtime, authorization, secret management, access management, audit logs, and other vital features.

Furthermore, Connery, supported by our community, provides a diverse collection of ready-to-use open-source plugins for added convenience.

## Prerequisites

To use Connery Actions in your LangChain agent, you need to do some preparation:

1. Set up the Connery runner using the [Quickstart](https://docs.connery.io/docs/platform/quick-start/) guide.
2. Install all the plugins with the actions you want to use in your agent.
3. Set environment variables `CONNERY_RUNNER_URL` and `CONNERY_RUNNER_API_KEY` so the toolkit can communicate with the Connery Runner.

## Example of using Connery Action Tool

In the example below, we fetch action by its ID from the Connery Runner and then call it with the specified parameters.
We use the ID of the **Send email** action from the [Gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin.
You can find action IDs in the Connery Runner.
