# ChromeAI

:::info
This feature is **experimental** and is subject to change.
:::

:::note
The `Built-in AI Early Preview Program` by Google is currently in beta. To apply for access or find more information, please visit [this link](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in).
:::

ChromeAI leverages the webGPU and Gemini Nano to run LLMs directly in the browser, without the need for an internet connection.
This allows for running faster and private models without ever having data leave the consumers device.

## Getting started

Once you've been granted access to the program, follow all steps to download the model.

Once downloaded, you can start using `ChromeAI` in the browser as follows:

```typescript
import { ChromeAI } from "@langchain/community/experimental/llms/chrome_ai";
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const model = new ChromeAI({
  temperature: 0.5, // Optional, defaults to 0.5
  topK: 40, // Optional, defaults to 40
});

const response = await model.invoke("Write me a short poem please");
```

### Streaming

`ChromeAI` also supports streaming chunks:

```typescript
let output: string | undefined = undefined;
for await (const chunk of await model.stream([message])) {
  if (!output) {
    output = chunk;
  } else {
    output = output + chunk;
  }
  console.log(output);
}
```
