# Together AI

Here's an example of calling a Together AI model as an LLM:

import TogetherAI from "@examples/models/llm/togetherai.ts";
import TogetherAIStream from "@examples/models/llm/togetherai_stream.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{TogetherAI}</CodeBlock>

You can run other models through Together by changing the `modelName` parameter.
