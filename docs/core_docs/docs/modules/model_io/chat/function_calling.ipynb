        "Tool calling allows a model to respond to a given prompt by generating output that matches a user-defined schema. While the name implies that the model is performing some action, this is actually not the case! The model is merely coming up with the arguments to a tool, and actually running a [tool](/docs/modules/agents/tools/) (or not) is up to the user. For example, if you want to [extract output matching some schema](/docs/use_cases/extraction/) from unstructured text, you could give the model an \"extraction\" tool that takes parameters matching the desired schema, then treat the generated output as your final result.\n",
