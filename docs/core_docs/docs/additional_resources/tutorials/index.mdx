## Deeplearning.ai

We've partnered with [Deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) and [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng)
on a LangChain.js short course.

It covers LCEL and other building blocks you can combine to build more complex chains, as well as fundamentals around
loading data for retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Try it for free below:

## Scrimba interactive guides

[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) is a code-learning platform that allows you to interactively edit and run
code while watching a video walkthrough.

We've partnered with Scrimba on course materials (called "scrims") that teach the fundamentals of building with LangChain.js -
check them out below, and check back for more as they become available!

### Learn LangChain.js

- [Learn LangChain.js on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/langchain)

An full end-to-end course that walks through how to build a chatbot that can answer questions about a provided document. A great
introduction to LangChain and a great first project for learning how to use LangChain Expression Language primitives to perform retrieval!

## DataCamp

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) is an online data science and AI education platform that provides interactive courses, projects and code-alongs.
More specifically, DataCamp has developed a [Become a Generative AI Developer series](https://www.datacamp.com/ai-code-alongs) featuring 9 free code-alongs, including ones on building chatbots using LangChain and the OpenAI and Pinecone APIs.
When you start a code along, you are launched into a fully configured notebook environment with an expert-led video to guide you through the project.
