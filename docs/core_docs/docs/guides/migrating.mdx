# Migrating from 0.0.x to 0.1.x

If you're still using the pre `0.1` version of LangChain, but want to upgrade to the latest version, we've created a script that can handle almost every aspect of the migration for you.

At a high level, the changes from `0.0` to `0.1` are only import path updates.
We've done our best to keep all core code functionality the same, so migrating can be as painless as possible.

In simple terms, this script will scan your codebase for any imports from `langchain/*`, and if it finds imports which have been moved to one of the following packages, it'll automatically update the import paths for you.
