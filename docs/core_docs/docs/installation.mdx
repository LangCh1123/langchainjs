# Installation

## Official release

To install LangChain run:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install langchain
```

This will install the bare minimum requirements of LangChain.
A lot of the value of LangChain comes when integrating it with various model providers, datastores, etc.
By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NOT installed. You will need to install the dependencies for specific integrations separately.

## LangChain core

The `@langchain/core` package contains base abstractions that the rest of the LangChain ecosystem uses, along with the LangChain Expression Language.
It is automatically installed by `langchain`, but can also be used separately. Install with:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/core
```

## LangChain community

The `@langchain/community` package contains third-party integrations.
It is automatically installed by `langchain`, but can also be used separately. Install with:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/community
```

:::note

`@langchain/community` will be removed as a dependency of `langchain` in version `0.2.0`.

:::

## LangGraph

`langgraph` is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, built on top of (and intended to be used with) LangChain.
Install with:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/langgraph
```

## LangSmith SDK

The LangSmith SDK is automatically installed by LangChain.
If not using LangChain, install with:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install langsmith
```
