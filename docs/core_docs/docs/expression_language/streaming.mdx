# Streaming With LangChain

Streaming is critical in making applications based on LLMs feel responsive to end-users.

Important LangChain primitives like LLMs, parsers, prompts, retrievers, and agents implement the LangChain Runnable Interface.

This interface provides two general approaches to stream content:

- `.stream()`: a default implementation of streaming that streams the final output from the chain.
- `streamEvents()` and `streamLog()`: these provide a way to stream both intermediate steps and final output from the chain.

Letâ€™s take a look at both approaches!
