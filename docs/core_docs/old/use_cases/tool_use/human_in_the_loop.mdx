# Human-in-the-loop

There are certain tools that we don’t trust a model to execute on its
own. One thing we can do in such situations is require human approval
before the tool is invoked.

## Setup

We’ll need to install the following packages:

```bash
npm install langchain @langchain/core @langchain/openai readline zod
```

We’ll use `readline` to handle accepting input from the user.

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to
use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set
your environment variables to start logging traces:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

## Chain

Suppose we have the following (dummy) tools and tool-calling chain:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import {
  Runnable,
  RunnableLambda,
  RunnablePassthrough,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { StructuredTool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { JsonOutputToolsParser } from "langchain/output_parsers";
import { z } from "zod";

class CountEmails extends StructuredTool {
  schema = z.object({
    lastNDays: z.number(),
  });

  name = "count_emails";

  description = "Count the number of emails sent in the last N days.";

  async _call(input: z.infer<typeof this.schema>): Promise<string> {
    return (input.lastNDays * 2).toString();
  }
}

class SendEmail extends StructuredTool {
  schema = z.object({
    message: z.string(),
    recipient: z.string(),
  });

  name = "send_email";

  description = "Send an email.";

  async _call(input: z.infer<typeof this.schema>): Promise<string> {
    return `Successfully sent email to ${input.recipient}`;
  }
}

const tools = [new CountEmails(), new SendEmail()];
```

```typescript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  temperature: 0,
}).bind({
  tools,
});

/**
 * Function for dynamically constructing the end of the chain based on the model-selected tool.
 */
const callTool = (toolInvocation: Record<string, any>): Runnable => {
  const toolMap: Record<string, StructuredTool> = tools.reduce((acc, tool) => {
    acc[tool.name] = tool;
    return acc;
  }, {});
  const tool = toolMap[toolInvocation.type];
  return RunnablePassthrough.assign({
    output: (input, config) => tool.invoke(input.args, config),
  });
};
```

```typescript
// .map() allows us to apply a function to a list of inputs.
const callToolList = new RunnableLambda({ func: callTool }).map();
const chain = model.pipe(new JsonOutputToolsParser()).pipe(callToolList);
```

```typescript
await chain.invoke("How many emails did I get in the last 5 days?");
```

```text
[ { type: "count_emails", args: { lastNDays: 5 }, output: "10" } ]
```

## Adding human approval

We can add a simple human approval step to our `toolChain` function:

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import HumanFeedback from "@examples/use_cases/human_in_the_loop/accept-feedback.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{HumanFeedback}</CodeBlock>
```
