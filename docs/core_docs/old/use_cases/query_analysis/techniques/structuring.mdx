# Structuring

One of the most important steps in retrieval is turning a text input
into the right search and filter parameters. This process of extracting
structured parameters from an unstructured input is what we refer to as
**query structuring**.

To illustrate, let’s return to our example of a Q&A bot over the
LangChain YouTube videos from the
[Quickstart](../../../../../docs/use_cases/query_analysis/quickstart)
and see what more complex structured queries might look like in this
case.

## Setup

#### Install dependencies

```mdx-code-block
import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";
import Npm2Yarn from "@theme/Npm2Yarn";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

<Npm2Yarn>
  @langchain/core zod
</Npm2Yarn>
```

#### Set environment variables

```text
# Optional, use LangSmith for best-in-class observability
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-api-key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
```

### Load example document

Let’s say we loaded a document with the following metadata:

```json
{
  "source": "pbAd8O1Lvm4",
  "title": "Self-reflective RAG with LangGraph: Self-RAG and CRAG",
  "description": "Unknown",
  "view_count": 9006,
  "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pbAd8O1Lvm4/hq720.jpg",
  "publish_date": "2024-02-07 00:00:00",
  "length": 1058,
  "author": "LangChain"
}
```

## Query schema

In order to generate structured queries we first need to define our
query schema. We can see that each document has a title, view count,
publication date, and length in seconds. Let’s assume we’ve built an
index that allows us to perform unstructured search over the contents
and title of each document, and to use range filtering on view count,
publication date, and length.

To start we’ll create a schema with explicit min and max attributes for
view count, publication date, and video length so that those can be
filtered on. And we’ll add separate attributes for searches against the
transcript contents versus the video title.

We could alternatively create a more generic schema where instead of
having one or more filter attributes for each filterable field, we have
a single `filters` attribute that takes a list of (attribute, condition,
value) tuples. We’ll demonstrate how to do this as well. Which approach
works best depends on the complexity of your index. If you have many
filterable fields then it may be better to have a single `filters` query
attribute. If you have only a few filterable fields and/or there are
fields that can only be filtered in very specific ways, it can be
helpful to have separate query attributes for them, each with their own
description.

```typescript
import { RunnableLambda } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { z } from "zod";

const tutorialSearch = z.object({
  content_search: z
    .string()
    .describe("Similarity search query applied to video transcripts."),
  title_search: z
    .string()
    .describe(
      "Alternate version of the content search query to apply to video titles. Should be succinct and only include key words that could be in a video title."
    ),
  min_view_count: z
    .number()
    .optional()
    .describe(
      "Minimum view count filter, inclusive. Only use if explicitly specified."
    ),
  max_view_count: z
    .number()
    .optional()
    .describe(
      "Maximum view count filter, exclusive. Only use if explicitly specified."
    ),
  earliest_publish_date: z
    .date()
    .optional()
    .describe(
      "Earliest publish date filter, inclusive. Only use if explicitly specified."
    ),
  latest_publish_date: z
    .date()
    .optional()
    .describe(
      "Latest publish date filter, exclusive. Only use if explicitly specified."
    ),
  min_length_sec: z
    .number()
    .optional()
    .describe(
      "Minimum video length in seconds, inclusive. Only use if explicitly specified."
    ),
  max_length_sec: z
    .number()
    .optional()
    .describe(
      "Maximum video length in seconds, exclusive. Only use if explicitly specified."
    ),
});

const prettyPrint = (obj: z.infer<typeof tutorialSearch>) => {
  for (const field in obj) {
    if (obj[field] !== undefined) {
      console.log(`${field}: ${JSON.stringify(obj[field], null, 2)}`);
    }
  }
};

const prettyPrintRunnable = new RunnableLambda({
  func: prettyPrint,
}).withConfig({ runName: "prettyPrint" });
```

## Query generation

To convert user questions to structured queries we’ll make use of a
function-calling model. LangChain has some nice constructors that make
it easy to specify a desired function call schema via a Zod schema:

```mdx-code-block
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />
```

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const system = `You are an expert at converting user questions into database queries.
You have access to a database of tutorial videos about a software library for building LLM-powered applications.
Given a question, return a database query optimized to retrieve the most relevant results.

If there are acronyms or words you are not familiar with, do not try to rephrase them.`;

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", system],
  ["human", "{question}"],
]);
const llmWithTools = llm.withStructuredOutput(tutorialSearch, {
  name: "TutorialSearch",
});
const queryAnalyzer = prompt.pipe(llmWithTools);
```

Let’s try it out:

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer
  .pipe(prettyPrintRunnable)
  .invoke({ question: "rag from scratch" });
```

```text
content_search: "rag from scratch"
title_search: "rag from scratch"
```

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer
  .pipe(prettyPrintRunnable)
  .invoke({ question: "videos on chat langchain published in 2023" });
```

```text
content_search: "chat langchain"
title_search: "2023"
earliest_publish_date: "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
latest_publish_date: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
```

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer.pipe(prettyPrintRunnable).invoke({
  question:
    "how to use multi-modal models in an agent, only videos under 5 minutes",
});
```

```text
content_search: "multi-modal models agent"
title_search: "multi-modal models agent"
max_length_sec: 300
```

## Alternative: Succinct schema

If we have many filterable fields then having a verbose schema could
harm performance, or may not even be possible given limitations on the
size of function schemas. In these cases we can try more succinct query
schemas that trade off some explicitness of direction for concision:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const Filter = z.object({
  field: z.union([
    z.literal("view_count"),
    z.literal("publish_date"),
    z.literal("length_sec"),
  ]),
  comparison: z.union([
    z.literal("eq"),
    z.literal("lt"),
    z.literal("lte"),
    z.literal("gt"),
    z.literal("gte"),
  ]),
  value: z
    .union([
      z.number(),
      z.string().refine((data) => !isNaN(Date.parse(data)), {
        message:
          "If field is publish_date then value must be a ISO-8601 format date",
      }),
    ])
    .describe(
      "If field is publish_date then value must be a ISO-8601 format date"
    ),
});

const tutorialSearch = z.object({
  content_search: z
    .string()
    .describe("Similarity search query applied to video transcripts."),
  title_search: z
    .string()
    .describe(
      "Alternate version of the content search query to apply to video titles. " +
        "Should be succinct and only include key words that could be in a video title."
    ),
  filters: z
    .array(Filter)
    .default([])
    .describe(
      "Filters over specific fields. Final condition is a logical conjunction of all filters."
    ),
});
```

```typescript
const llmWithTools = llm.withStructuredOutput(tutorialSearch, {
  name: "TutorialSearch",
});
const queryAnalyzer = prompt.pipe(llmWithTools);
```

Let’s try it out:

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer
  .pipe(prettyPrintRunnable)
  .invoke({ question: "rag from scratch" });
```

```text
content_search: "rag from scratch"
title_search: "rag"
filters: []
```

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer
  .pipe(prettyPrintRunnable)
  .invoke({ question: "videos on chat langchain published in 2023" });
```

```text
content_search: "chat langchain"
title_search: "chat langchain"
filters: [
  {
    "field": "publish_date",
    "comparison": "gte",
    "value": "2023-01-01"
  }
]
```

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer.pipe(prettyPrintRunnable).invoke({
  question:
    "how to use multi-modal models in an agent, only videos under 5 minutes and with over 276 views",
});
```

```text
content_search: "multi-modal models in an agent"
title_search: "multi-modal models"
filters: [
  {
    "field": "length_sec",
    "comparison": "lt",
    "value": 300
  },
  {
    "field": "view_count",
    "comparison": "gte",
    "value": 276
  }
]
```

We can see that the analyzer handles integers well but struggles with
date ranges. We can try adjusting our schema description and/or our
prompt to correct this:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const tutorialSearch = z.object({
  content_search: z
    .string()
    .describe("Similarity search query applied to video transcripts."),
  title_search: z
    .string()
    .describe(
      "Alternate version of the content search query to apply to video titles. " +
        "Should be succinct and only include key words that could be in a video title."
    ),
  filters: z
    .array(Filter)
    .default([])
    .describe(
      "Filters over specific fields. Final condition is a logical conjunction of all filters. " +
        "If a time period longer than one day is specified then it must result in filters that define a date range. " +
        `Keep in mind the current date is ${
          new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0]
        }.`
    ),
});
```

```typescript
const llmWithTools = llm.withStructuredOutput(tutorialSearch, {
  name: "TutorialSearch",
});
const queryAnalyzer = prompt.pipe(llmWithTools);
```

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer
  .pipe(prettyPrintRunnable)
  .invoke({ question: "videos on chat langchain published in 2023" });
```

```text
content_search: "chat langchain"
title_search: "chat langchain"
filters: [
  {
    "field": "publish_date",
    "comparison": "eq",
    "value": "2023"
  }
]
```

This seems to work!

## Sorting: Going beyond search

With certain indexes searching by field isn’t the only way to retrieve
results — we can also sort documents by a field and retrieve the top
sorted results. With structured querying this is easy to accomodate by
adding separate query fields that specify how to sort results.

```typescript
const tutorialSearch = z.object({
  content_search: z
    .string()
    .default("")
    .describe("Similarity search query applied to video transcripts."),
  title_search: z
    .string()
    .default("")
    .describe(
      "Alternate version of the content search query to apply to video titles. " +
        "Should be succinct and only include key words that could be in a video title."
    ),
  min_view_count: z
    .number()
    .optional()
    .describe("Minimum view count filter, inclusive."),
  max_view_count: z
    .number()
    .optional()
    .describe("Maximum view count filter, exclusive."),
  earliest_publish_date: z
    .date()
    .optional()
    .describe("Earliest publish date filter, inclusive."),
  latest_publish_date: z
    .date()
    .optional()
    .describe("Latest publish date filter, exclusive."),
  min_length_sec: z
    .number()
    .optional()
    .describe("Minimum video length in seconds, inclusive."),
  max_length_sec: z
    .number()
    .optional()
    .describe("Maximum video length in seconds, exclusive."),
  sort_by: z
    .enum(["relevance", "view_count", "publish_date", "length"])
    .default("relevance")
    .describe("Attribute to sort by."),
  sort_order: z
    .enum(["ascending", "descending"])
    .default("descending")
    .describe("Whether to sort in ascending or descending order."),
});
```

```typescript
const llmWithTools = llm.withStructuredOutput(tutorialSearch, {
  name: "TutorialSearch",
});
const queryAnalyzer = prompt.pipe(llmWithTools);
```

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer
  .pipe(prettyPrintRunnable)
  .invoke({ question: "What has LangChain released lately?" });
```

```text
title_search: "LangChain"
sort_by: "publish_date"
sort_order: "descending"
```

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer
  .pipe(prettyPrintRunnable)
  .invoke({ question: "What are the longest videos?" });
```

```text
sort_by: "length"
sort_order: "descending"
```

We can even support searching and sorting together. This might look like
first retrieving all results above a relevancy threshold and then
sorting them according to the specified attribute:

```typescript
await queryAnalyzer
  .pipe(prettyPrintRunnable)
  .invoke({ question: "What are the shortest videos about agents?" });
```

```text
content_search: "agents"
sort_by: "length"
sort_order: "ascending"
```
