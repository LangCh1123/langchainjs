# Graphs

One of the common types of databases that we can build Q&A systems for
are graph databases. LangChain comes with a number of built-in chains
and agents that are compatible with graph query language dialects like
Cypher, Neo4j, and MemGraph. They enable use cases such as:

- Generating queries that will be run based on natural language
  questions,
- Creating chatbots that can answer questions based on database data,
- Building custom dashboards based on insights a user wants to
  analyze,

and much more.

## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️ {#security-note}

Building Q&A systems of graph databases might require executing
model-generated database queries. There are inherent risks in doing
this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always
scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent’s needs. This will
mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven
system. For more on general security best practices, [see
here](../../../../docs/security).
