# Citations

How can we get a model to cite which parts of the source documents it
referenced in its response?

To explore some techniques for extracting citations, let’s first create
a simple RAG chain. To start we’ll just retrieve from the web using the
[TavilySearchAPIRetriever](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/tavily).

## Setup

### Dependencies

We’ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Memory vector store
in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any
[ChatModel](../../../../docs/modules/model_io/chat) or
[LLM](../../../../docs/modules/model_io/llms),
[Embeddings](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/),
and
[VectorStore](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/)
or [Retriever](../../../../docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/).

We’ll use the following packages:

```bash
npm install --save langchain @langchain/community @langchain/openai
```

We need to set environment variables for Tavily Search & OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
export TAVILY_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple
steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get
more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what
exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this
is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to
use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set
your environment variables to start logging traces:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### Initial setup

```typescript
import { TavilySearchAPIRetriever } from "@langchain/community/retrievers/tavily_search_api";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  temperature: 0,
});
const retriever = new TavilySearchAPIRetriever({
  k: 6,
});
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [
    "system",
    "You're a helpful AI assistant. Given a user question and some web article snippets, answer the user question. If none of the articles answer the question, just say you don't know.\n\nHere are the web articles:{context}",
  ],
  ["human", "{question}"],
]);
```

Now that we’ve got a model, retriever and prompt, let’s chain them all
together. We’ll need to add some logic for formatting our retrieved
`Document`s to a string that can be passed to our prompt. We’ll make it
so our chain returns both the answer and the retrieved Documents.

```typescript
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { RunnableMap, RunnablePassthrough } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

/**
 * Format the documents into a readable string.
 */
const formatDocs = (input: Record<string, any>): string => {
  const { docs } = input;
  return (
    "\n\n" +
    docs
      .map(
        (doc: Document) =>
          `Article title: ${doc.metadata.title}\nArticle Snippet: ${doc.pageContent}`
      )
      .join("\n\n")
  );
};
// subchain for generating an answer once we've done retrieval
const answerChain = prompt.pipe(llm).pipe(new StringOutputParser());
const map = RunnableMap.from({
  question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  docs: retriever,
});
// complete chain that calls the retriever -> formats docs to string -> runs answer subchain -> returns just the answer and retrieved docs.
const chain = map
  .assign({ context: formatDocs })
  .assign({ answer: answerChain })
  .pick(["answer", "docs"]);
```

```typescript
await chain.invoke("How fast are cheetahs?");
```

## Function-calling

### Cite documents

Let’s try using [OpenAI
function-calling](../../../../docs/modules/model_io/chat/function_calling)
to make the model specify which of the provided documents it’s actually
referencing when answering. LangChain has some utils for converting
objects or zod objects to the JSONSchema format expected by OpenAI, so
we’ll use that to define our functions:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { StructuredTool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { formatToOpenAITool } from "@langchain/openai";

class CitedAnswer extends StructuredTool {
  name = "cited_answer";

  description =
    "Answer the user question based only on the given sources, and cite the sources used.";

  schema = z.object({
    answer: z
      .string()
      .describe(
        "The answer to the user question, which is based only on the given sources."
      ),
    citations: z
      .array(z.number())
      .describe(
        "The integer IDs of the SPECIFIC sources which justify the answer."
      ),
  });

  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  _call(input: z.infer<(typeof this)["schema"]>): Promise<string> {
    return Promise.resolve(JSON.stringify(input, null, 2));
  }
}

const asOpenAITool = formatToOpenAITool(new CitedAnswer());
const tools1 = [asOpenAITool];
```

Let’s see what the model output is like when we pass in our functions
and a user input:

```typescript
const llmWithTool1 = llm.bind({
  tools: tools1,
  tool_choice: asOpenAITool,
});

const exampleQ = `What Brian's height?

Source: 1
Information: Suzy is 6'2"

Source: 2
Information: Jeremiah is blonde

Source: 3
Information: Brian is 3 inches shorted than Suzy`;

await llmWithTool1.invoke(exampleQ);
```

```text

  lc_serializable: true,
  lc_kwargs: {
    content: "",
    additional_kwargs: {
      function_call: undefined,

          type: "function",

    }
  },

        type: "function",
        function: {
          name: "cited_answer",
          arguments: "{\n" +
            `  "answer": "Brian's height is 6'2\\" - 3 inches",\n` +
            '  "citations": [1, 3]\n' +
            "}"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We’ll add an output parser to convert the OpenAI API response to a nice
object. We use the
[JsonOutputKeyToolsParser](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_output_parsers.JsonOutputKeyToolsParser.html)
for this:

```typescript
import { JsonOutputKeyToolsParser } from "langchain/output_parsers";

const outputParser = new JsonOutputKeyToolsParser({
  keyName: "cited_answer",
  returnSingle: true,
});

await llmWithTool1.pipe(outputParser).invoke(exampleQ);
```

```text
{ answer: `Brian's height is 6'2" - 3 inches`, citations: [ 1, 3 ] }
```

```typescript
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const formatDocsWithId = (docs: Array<Document>): string => {
  return (
    "\n\n" +
    docs
      .map(
        (doc: Document, idx: number) =>
          `Source ID: ${idx}\nArticle title: ${doc.metadata.title}\nArticle Snippet: ${doc.pageContent}`
      )
      .join("\n\n")
  );
};
// subchain for generating an answer once we've done retrieval
const answerChain1 = prompt.pipe(llmWithTool1).pipe(outputParser);
const map1 = RunnableMap.from({
  question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  docs: retriever,
});
// complete chain that calls the retriever -> formats docs to string -> runs answer subchain -> returns just the answer and retrieved docs.
const chain1 = map1
  .assign({
    context: (input: { docs: Array<Document> }) => formatDocsWithId(input.docs),

### Cite snippets

What if we want to cite actual text spans? We can try to get our model
to return these, too.

_Aside: Note that if we break up our documents so that we have many
documents with only a sentence or two instead of a few long documents,
citing documents becomes roughly equivalent to citing snippets, and may
be easier for the model because the model just needs to return an
identifier for each snippet instead of the actual text. Probably worth
trying both approaches and evaluating._

```typescript
const citationSchema = z.object({
  sourceId: z
    .number()
    .describe(
      "The integer ID of a SPECIFIC source which justifies the answer."
    ),
  quote: z
    .string()
    .describe(
      "The VERBATIM quote from the specified source that justifies the answer."
    ),
});

class QuotedAnswer extends StructuredTool {
  name = "quoted_answer";

  description =
    "Answer the user question based only on the given sources, and cite the sources used.";

  schema = z.object({
    answer: z
      .string()
      .describe(
        "The answer to the user question, which is based only on the given sources."
      ),
    citations: z
      .array(citationSchema)
      .describe("Citations from the given sources that justify the answer."),
  });

  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  _call(input: z.infer<(typeof this)["schema"]>): Promise<string> {
    return Promise.resolve(JSON.stringify(input, null, 2));
  }
}

const quotedAnswerTool = formatToOpenAITool(new QuotedAnswer());
const tools2 = [quotedAnswerTool];

## Direct prompting

Most models don’t yet support function-calling. We can achieve similar
results with direct prompting. Let’s see what this looks like using an
Anthropic chat model that is particularly proficient in working with
XML:

### Setup

Install the LangChain Anthropic integration package:

```bash
npm install @langchain/anthropic
```

Add your Anthropic API key to your environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

```typescript
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const anthropic = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-instant-1.2",
});
const system = `You're a helpful AI assistant. Given a user question and some web article snippets,
answer the user question and provide citations. If none of the articles answer the question, just say you don't know.

Remember, you must return both an answer and citations. A citation consists of a VERBATIM quote that
justifies the answer and the ID of the quote article. Return a citation for every quote across all articles
that justify the answer. Use the following format for your final output:

<cited_answer>
    <answer></answer>
    <citations>
        <citation><source_id></source_id><quote></quote></citation>
        <citation><source_id></source_id><quote></quote></citation>
        ...
    </citations>
</cited_answer>

Here are the web articles:{context}`;

const anthropicPrompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", system],
  ["human", "{question}"],
]);
```

```typescript
import { XMLOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";
import {
  RunnableLambda,
  RunnablePassthrough,
  RunnableMap,
} from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const formatDocsToXML = (docs: Array<Document>): string => {
  const formatted: Array<string> = [];
  docs.forEach((doc, idx) => {
    const docStr = `<source id="${idx}">
  <title>${doc.metadata.title}</title>
  <article_snippet>${doc.pageContent}</article_snippet>
</source>`;
    formatted.push(docStr);
  });
  return `\n\n<sources>${formatted.join("\n")}</sources>`;
};

const format3 = new RunnableLambda({
  func: (input: { docs: Array<Document> }) => formatDocsToXML(input.docs),
});
const answerChain = anthropicPrompt
  .pipe(anthropic)
  .pipe(new XMLOutputParser())
  .pipe(

## Retrieval post-processing

Another approach is to post-process our retrieved documents to compress
the content, so that the source content is already minimal enough that
we don’t need the model to cite specific sources or spans. For example,
we could break up each document into a sentence or two, embed those and
keep only the most relevant ones. LangChain has some built-in components
for this. Here we’ll use a
[RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/recursive_text_splitter),
which creates chunks of a specified size by splitting on separator
substrings, and an
[EmbeddingsFilter](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/contextual_compression#embeddingsfilter),
which keeps only the texts with the most relevant embeddings.

```typescript
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";
import { EmbeddingsFilter } from "langchain/retrievers/document_compressors/embeddings_filter";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { DocumentInterface } from "@langchain/core/documents";
import { RunnableMap, RunnablePassthrough } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 400,
  chunkOverlap: 0,
  separators: ["\n\n", "\n", ".", " "],
  keepSeparator: false,
});

const compressor = new EmbeddingsFilter({
  embeddings: new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
  k: 10,
});

const splitAndFilter = async (input): Promise<Array<DocumentInterface>> => {
  const { docs, question } = input;
  const splitDocs = await splitter.splitDocuments(docs);
  const statefulDocs = await compressor.compressDocuments(splitDocs, question);
  return statefulDocs;
};

const retrieveMap = RunnableMap.from({
  question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  docs: retriever,
});

const retrieve = retrieveMap.pipe(splitAndFilter);
const docs = await retrieve.invoke("How fast are cheetahs?");
for (const doc of docs) {
  console.log(doc.pageContent, "\n\n");
}
```

The maximum speed cheetahs have been measured at is 114 km (71 miles) per hour, and they routinely reach velocities of 80–100 km (50–62 miles) per hour while pursuing prey.

The science of cheetah speed
The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is the fastest land animal on Earth, capable of reaching speeds as high as 75 mph or 120 km/h. Cheetahs are predators that sneak up on their prey and sprint a short distance to chase and attack.
 Key Takeaways: How Fast Can a Cheetah Run?
Fastest Cheetah on Earth


Built for speed, the cheetah can accelerate from zero to 45 in just 2.5 seconds and reach top speeds of 60 to 70 mph, making it the fastest land mammal! Fun Facts

NZCBI staff in Front Royal, Virginia, are mourning the loss of Walnut, a white-naped crane who became an internet sensation for choosing one of her keepers as her mate.


Scientists calculate a cheetah's top speed is 75 mph, but the fastest recorded speed is somewhat slower. The top 10 fastest animals are:


The pronghorn, an American animal resembling an antelope, is the fastest land animal in the Western Hemisphere. While a cheetah's top speed ranges from 65 to 75 mph (104 to 120 km/h), its average speed is only 40 mph (64 km/hr), punctuated by short bursts at its top speed. Basically, if a predator threatens to take a cheetah's kill or attack its young, a cheetah has to run.


A cheetah eats a variety of small animals, including game birds, rabbits, small antelopes (including the springbok, impala, and gazelle), young warthogs, and larger antelopes (such as the kudu, hartebeest, oryx, and roan). Their faces are distinguished by prominent black lines that curve from the inner corner of each eye to the outer corners of the mouth, like a well-worn trail of inky tears.


4 kg) Cheetah moms spend a lot of time teaching their cubs to chase, sometimes dragging live animals back to the den so the cubs can practice the chase-and-catch process


Advertisement If confronted, a roughly 125-pound cheetah will always run rather than fight -- it's too weak, light and thin to have any chance against something like a lion, which can be twice as long as a cheetah and weigh more than 400 pounds (181


Cheetahs eat a variety of small animals, including game birds, rabbits, small antelopes (including the springbok, impala, and gazelle), young warthogs, and larger antelopes (such as the kudu, hartebeest, oryx, and roan)


Historically, cheetahs ranged widely throughout Africa and Asia, from the Cape of Good Hope to the Mediterranean, throughout the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, from Israel, India and Pakistan north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India.

## Generation post-processing

Another approach is to post-process our model generation. In this
example we’ll first generate just an answer, and then we’ll ask the
model to annotate it’s own answer with citations. The downside of this
approach is of course that it is slower and more expensive, because two
model calls need to be made.

Let’s apply this to our initial chain.

```typescript
import { StructuredTool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { formatToOpenAITool } from "@langchain/openai";
import { z } from "zod";

class AnnotatedAnswer extends StructuredTool {
  name = "annotated_answer";

  description =
    "Annotate the answer to the user question with quote citations that justify the answer";

  schema = z.object({
    citations: z
      .array(citationSchema)
      .describe("Citations from the given sources that justify the answer."),
  });

  _call(input: z.infer<(typeof this)["schema"]>): Promise<string> {
    return Promise.resolve(JSON.stringify(input, null, 2));
  }
}

const annotatedAnswerTool = formatToOpenAITool(new AnnotatedAnswer());

const llmWithTools5 = llm.bind({
  tools: [annotatedAnswerTool],
  tool_choice: annotatedAnswerTool,
});
```

```typescript
import {
  ChatPromptTemplate,
  MessagesPlaceholder,
} from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { JsonOutputKeyToolsParser } from "langchain/output_parsers";
import { RunnableMap, RunnablePassthrough } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { AIMessage, ToolMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const prompt5 = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  [
    "system",
    "You're a helpful AI assistant. Given a user question and some web article snippets, answer the user question. If none of the articles answer the question, just say you don't know.\n\nHere are the web articles:{context}",
  ],
  ["human", "{question}"],
  new MessagesPlaceholder({
    variableName: "chat_history",
    optional: true,
  }),
  new MessagesPlaceholder({
    variableName: "toolMessage",
    optional: true,
  }),
]);

const answerChain5 = prompt5.pipe(llmWithTools5);
const annotationChain = RunnableSequence.from([
  prompt5,
  llmWithTools5,
  new JsonOutputKeyToolsParser({
    keyName: "annotated_answer",
    returnSingle: true,
  }),
  (input: any) => input.citations,
]);
const map5 = RunnableMap.from({
  question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  docs: retriever,
});
const chain5 = map5
  .assign({ context: formatDocs })
  .assign({ aiMessage: answerChain5 })
  .assign({
    chat_history: (input) => input.aiMessage,
    toolMessage: (input) =>
      new ToolMessage({
        tool_call_id: input.aiMessage.additional_kwargs.tool_calls[0].id,
        content: input.aiMessage.additional_kwargs.content ?? "",
      }),
  })
  .assign({
    annotations: annotationChain,
  })
  .pick(["answer", "docs", "annotations"]);

await chain5.invoke("How fast are cheetahs?");
