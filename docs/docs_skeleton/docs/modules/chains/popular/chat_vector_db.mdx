Conversational Retrieval QA chains are built by first combining the chat history (either explicitly passed in or retrieved from the provided memory) and the question into a standalone question, then looks up relevant documents from the retriever, and finally passes those documents and the question to a question answering chain to return a response.

To create one, you will need a retriever. In the below example, we will create one from a vector store, which can be created from embeddings.
