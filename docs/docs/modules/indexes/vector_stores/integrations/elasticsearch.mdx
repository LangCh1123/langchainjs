# Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
It provides a distributed, multi-tenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free
JSON documents.

## Setup

### 1. Install the Elasticsearch SDK

Install the SDK as follows

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -S @elastic/elasticsearch
```

### 2. Fetch Elasticsearch API credentials or Run Elasticsearch locally with docker

You can sign up for a free Elasticsearch account [here](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration).

Once you have signed up for the Elasticsearch account, set up your deployment per the instructions [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-getting-started.html).

Alternatively, you can run Elasticsearch locally with docker as follows

```bash
docker-compose -f examples/src/indexes/vector_stores/elasticsearch/docker-compose.yml up
```

## Index and query docs

import FromDocs from "@examples/indexes/vector_stores/elasticsearch/fromDocuments.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{FromDocs}</CodeBlock>
