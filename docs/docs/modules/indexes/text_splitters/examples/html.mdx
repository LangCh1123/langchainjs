# HtmlTextSplitter

The `HtmlTextSplitter` splits your input content into documents based on common HTML tags.
Given a standard HTML page input, this results in more semantically self-contained chunks that are more useful to a vector store or other retriever.

Here's an example of it in action:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/indexes/html_text_splitter.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
