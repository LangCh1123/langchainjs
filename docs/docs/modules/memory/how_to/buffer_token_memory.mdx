# Conversation token buffer memory

This notebook covers how to use `ConversationTokenBufferMemory`. This memory keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.

Below is a basic demonstration of the usage of token buffer memory.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/memory/token_buffer.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

We can also get the history as a list of messages, useful if you are using this with `MessagesPlaceholder` in a chat prompt template.

```typescript
const memory = new ConversationTokenBufferMemory({
  llm: model,
  maxTokenLimit: 10,
  returnMessages: true,
});
```
