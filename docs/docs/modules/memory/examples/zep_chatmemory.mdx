# Zep Chat Memory
For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory chatHistory that backs chat memory classes like BufferMemory for a Zep instance.

## Setup
[Zep](https://github.com/getzep/zep) is a memory server that stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches conversational AI chat histories, autonomous agent histories, document Q&A histories and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.
See instructions at [Zep](https://github.com/getzep/zep) for running the server locally or through an automated hosting provider.

## Usage :

You can use Zep Chat Memory to provide long term storage for conversational memory related your chats.
