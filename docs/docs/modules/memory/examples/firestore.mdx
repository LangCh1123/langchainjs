# firestore Chat Memory in firebase functions

For longer-term persistence across chat sessions, you can swap out the default in-memory `chatHistory` that backs chat memory classes like `BufferMemory` for a firestore.

## Setup

First, install the firebase admin in your project:

```bash npm2yarn
yarn add @firebase-admin
```

Go to your the Settings icon Project settings in the Firebase console.
In the Your apps card, select the nickname of the app for which you need a config object.
Select Config from the Firebase SDK snippet pane.
Copy the config object snippet, then add it to your firebase functions FirestoreChatMessageHistory.

## Usage

import Example from "@examples/memory/firestore.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
