# Integrations: Chat Models

LangChain offers a number of Chat Models implementations that integrate with various model providers. These are:

## `ChatOpenAI`

import OpenAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAI}</CodeBlock>

## Azure `ChatOpenAI`

import AzureOpenAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_azure_openai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{AzureOpenAI}</CodeBlock>

## `ChatAnthropic`

import Anthropic from "@examples/models/chat/integration_anthropic.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Anthropic}</CodeBlock>

## Google Vertex AI

The Vertex AI implementation is meant to be used in Node.js and not
directly from a browser, since it requires a service account to use.

Before running this code, you should make sure the Vertex AI API is
enabled for the relevant project and that you've authenticated to
Google Cloud using one of these methods:

- You are logged into an account (using `gcloud auth application-default login`)
  permitted to that project.
- You are running on a machine using a service account that is permitted
  to the project.
- You have downloaded the credentials for a service account that is permitted
  to the project and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment
  variable to the path of this file.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install google-auth-library
```

The ChatGoogleVertexAI class works just like other chat-based LLMs,
mapping any SystemChatMessage objects into the "context" parameter
that the PaLM model expects.

import ChatGoogleVertexAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_googlevertexai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ChatGoogleVertexAI}</CodeBlock>

However, there are options that can be provided either as part of the constructor or
in options when calling the model.

The `context` parameter provides basic instructions for how the model should respond.
Any SystemChatMessage in the questions will override this parameter.

The `examples` parameter can help the model understand what an appropriate response
looks like.
