# Tools

A tool is an abstraction around a function that makes it easy for a language model to interact with it. Specifically, the interface of a tool has a single text input and a single text output. And it includes a name and description that communicate to the [Model](../../models/) what the tool does and whne to use it.

```typescript
interface Tool {
  call(arg: string): Promise<string>;

  name: string;

  description: string;
}
```

## All Tools

<DocCardList />

## Advanced

To implement a custom tool you can subclass the `Tool` class and implement the `_call` method. The `_call` method is called with the input text and should return the output text. The Tool superclass implements the `call` method, which takes care of calling the right CallbackManager methods before and after calling your `_call` method.

```typescript
abstract class Tool {
  abstract _call(arg: string): Promise<string>;

  abstract name: string;

  abstract description: string;
}
```
