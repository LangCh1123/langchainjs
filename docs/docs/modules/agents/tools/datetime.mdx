# Date Time Tool

This tool empowers agents with the ability to determine the present date and time. Its usefulness lies in liberating models from the constraints of being stuck in a snapshot of the past, where they were originally trained.

## Usage, standalone

import ToolExample from "@examples/tools/datetime.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ToolExample}</CodeBlock>
