# Composition: Teams of agents working together

By implementing your Agents as a set of custom tools, you can easily compose specialized Agents designed to work together in pursuit of a singular objective.

Using a "manager-delegate" model, the agent driven by the agent executor will delegate work and tasks to the agents at their disposal.

In the example below, the manager agent provides the ZIP code to its delegages which use that information to retrieve sports and current events news given a specific location. The manager aggregates this information to deliver a concise aggregated news summary to the user.
