# Agents

An agent is a stateless wrapper around an agent prompt chain (such as MRKL) which takes care of formatting tools into the prompt, as well as parsing the responses obtained from the chat model. It takes in user input and returns a response corresponding to an “action” to take and a corresponding “action input”.

```typescript
interface AgentStep {
  action: AgentAction;
  observation: string;
}

interface AgentAction {
  tool: string; // Tool.name
  toolInput: string; // Tool.call argument
}

interface AgentFinish {
  returnValues: object;
}

class Agent {
  plan(steps: AgentStep[], inputs: object): Promise<AgentAction | AgentFinish>;
}
```
