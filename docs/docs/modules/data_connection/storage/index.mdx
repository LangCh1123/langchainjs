# Storage

Storing data in key value format is quick and efficient, and can be a powerful tool for LLM applications. The `BaseStore` class provides a simple interface for getting, setting, deleting and iterating over lists of key value pairs.

The public API of `BaseStore` in LangChain.js offers four main methods:

```typescript
abstract mget(keys: K[]): Promise<(V | undefined)[]>;

abstract mset(keyValuePairs: [K, V][]): Promise<void>;

abstract mdelete(keys: K[]): Promise<void>;

abstract yieldKeys(prefix?: string): AsyncGenerator<K | string>;
```

The `m` prefix stands for multiple, and indicates that these methods can be used to get, set and delete multiple key value pairs at once.
The `yieldKeys` method is a generator function that can be used to iterate over all keys in the store, or all keys with a given prefix.

It's that simple!

So far LangChain.js has three integrations for `BaseStore`:

- `IORedis`
- `Vercel KV`
- `Upstash Redis`

## Use Cases

**Chat history**
If you're building web apps with chat, the `BaseStore` family of integrations can come in very handy for storing and retrieving chat history.

**Caching**
The `BaseStore` family can be a useful alternative to our other caching integrations.
For example the `Vercel KV` fits very nicely if you're already building with the Vercel cloud platform.

See the individual sections for deeper dives on specific storage providers.
