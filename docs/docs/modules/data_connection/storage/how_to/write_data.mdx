# Writing Data

Writing data is simple with KV stores. Below is an example using the `InMemoryStore` and the `.mset()` method.
We'll also set our generic value type to `Date` so we can have type safety setting our dates.

Import the `InMemoryStore` class.

```typescript
import { InMemoryStore } from "langchain/storage/in_memory";
```

Instantiate a new instance and pass `Date` as our generic for the value type.

```typescript
const store = new InMemoryStore<Date>();
```

Finally we can call `.mset()` to write multiple values at once.

```typescript
const data = [
  ["date1", new Date()],
  ["date2", new Date()],
];

await store.mset(data);
```

## Using File System

When using the file system integration we need to instantiate via the `fromPath` method. This is required because it needs to preform checks to ensure the directory exists and is readable/writable.
You also must use a directory when using `LocalFileStore` because each entry is stored as a unique file in the directory.

```typescript
import { LocalFileStore } from "langchain/storage/file_system";
```

```typescript
const pathToStore = "./my-store-directory";
const store = await LocalFileStore.fromPath(pathToStore);
```

```typescript
const data = [
  ["date1", new Date()],
  ["date2", new Date()],
];

await store.mset(data);
```
