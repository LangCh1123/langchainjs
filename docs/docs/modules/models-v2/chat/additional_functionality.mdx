# Additional Functionality: Chat Models

We offer a number of additional features for chat models. In the examples below, we'll be using the `ChatOpenAI` model.

## Additional Methods

LangChain provides a number of additional methods for interacting with chat models:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Streaming

Similar to LLMs, you can stream responses from a chat model. This is useful for chatbots that need to respond to user input in real-time.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamingExample}</CodeBlock>
