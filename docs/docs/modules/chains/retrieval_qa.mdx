# Retrieval QA

The RetrievalQA chain operates by taking a question as input, searching for relevant documents in the retriever, and passing both the documents and the question to a question answering chain, which returns a response.

To create one, you will need a retriever. In this example we will create one from a vectorstore, which can be created from embeddings.

## Usage

Below is an end-to-end example of doing question answering over a recent state of the union address.
