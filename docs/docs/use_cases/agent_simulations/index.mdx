# Agent Simulations

Agent Simulations aim to simulate certain aspects of human behavior. You can use different types of agents, such as CAMEL agents or generative agents. It depends on what you want to use them for.

They tend to use an LLM as their "core" and simulator classes to prompt them to respond to certain stimuli such as a prebuilt "observation". If you want to have them use some form of memory for improved simulations (like with generative agents) then you will probably have to equip them with a vector store and a retriever.

Like Autonomous Agents, Agent Simulations are still pretty experimental and based on papers such as [this one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442).
