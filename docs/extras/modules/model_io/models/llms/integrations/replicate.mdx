# Replicate

Here's an example of calling a Replicate model as an LLM:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install replicate
```

```typescript
import { Replicate } from "langchain/llms/replicate";

const model = new Replicate({
  model:
    "daanelson/flan-t5:04e422a9b85baed86a4f24981d7f9953e20c5fd82f6103b74ebc431588e1cec8",
  apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.REPLICATE_API_KEY
});
const res = await model.call(
  "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks?"
);
console.log({ res });
```
