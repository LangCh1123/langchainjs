import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import ExampleSimilarity from "@examples/prompts/semantic_similarity_example_selector.ts";

The examples object will be used as parameters to format `examplePrompt` in the example below. Each example
should therefore have fields matching the parameters of the example prompt you are using.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleSimilarity}</CodeBlock>

By default, each field in the examples object is concatenated together and embedded. If you only want to embed specific keys
(for example, if you only want to search for similar input queries to the one you're receiving), you can pass an `inputKeys` 
parameter in the final `options` parameter.

## Loading from an existing vectorstore

You can also use a pre-initialized vector store and add more examples to it by passing it to the constructor directly as follows:

import ExampleSimilarityFromExisting from "@examples/prompts/semantic_similarity_example_selector_from_existing.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleSimilarityFromExisting}</CodeBlock>

## Metadata filtering

When adding examples, each field is available as metadata in the produced document. If you would like further control over your
search space, you can add extra fields to your examples and pass a `filter` parameter when initializing your selector:

import ExampleSimilarityMetadataFiltering from "@examples/prompts/semantic_similarity_example_selector_metadata_filtering.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleSimilarityMetadataFiltering}</CodeBlock>
