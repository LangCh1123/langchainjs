 * Steps to run this test:
 * 1. Create a Vectara account at https://console.vectara.com/signup
 * 2. Create a corpus with the following filter attributes:
 *      lang (level: part, data type: text)
 *      is_title (level: part, data type:  boolean)
 *      can_fly (level: document, data type: boolean)
 *      category (level: document, data type: string)
 *    Note: make sure to create an empty corpus (without any documents or text)
 * 3. Set the appropriate environment variables in your .env file (VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID, VECTARA_CORPUS_ID, VECTARA_API_KEY)
 * 4. Run the test

  const lion = `The lion, often referred to as the "king of the jungle, " is one of the largest and most powerful 
    members of the cat family, known for its majestic mane and powerful roar. These carnivorous mammals reside primarily 
    in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, where they roam grasslands and open plains in prides consisting of related 
    females, their offspring, and a coalition of males. Lions are known for their cooperative hunting strategy and deep 
    social bonds, marking them as unique among the world's wild cats.`;

  const flyingSquirrel = `The flying squirrel is a fascinating mammal known for its ability to glide through the air. 
    These nocturnal creatures are found in a variety of habitats, including forests and suburban areas across parts of 
    North America, Europe, and Asia. They possess a unique patagium, a membrane that extends from wrist to ankle, 
    facilitating their gliding abilities. Despite their name, flying squirrels don't technically fly but instead extend 
    their arms and legs to glide from tree to tree, using their tail for steering and balance.`;

  const penguin = `Penguins are flightless seabirds known for their distinct tuxedo-like appearance and waddling walk. 
    They are primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in Antarctica, but species can also be found in 
    South Africa, South America, New Zealand, and the Galapagos Islands. Penguins are expert swimmers, using their 
    flippers for propulsion and their feet as rudders, and they can dive deep into the ocean to catch their diet of fish, 
    squid, and krill.`;

  const turtle = `Turtles are cold-blooded reptiles identifiable by their bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their 
    ribs. They are one of the oldest and most primitive groups of reptiles and have been on Earth for more than 200 million 
    years. Found in various habitats from deserts to marine environments around the globe, turtles are known for their 
    slow movement on land, longevity, and often complex mating and nesting behaviors.`;
