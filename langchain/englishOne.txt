It all depends on what you want. You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin to the
    bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself.
    But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your
    friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what Gandalf has told you. We know a good
    deal about the Ring. We are horribly afraid - but we are coming with you; or following you
    like hounds.
