# TODO:
- [x] Delete method
- [x] Filter for vector data (where clause)
- [x] Linting
- [x] Formatting
- [x] Integration tests
- [w] delete all not working (continuation items)?
  * batch not working
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] @langchain/azure-cosmosdb package
- [x] update docs + imports
- [x] deprecate mongo vcore in favor of new package
- [x] AAD auth token provider
- [ ] Q: missing enableCrossPartitionQuery?
- [ ] issue delete: 429 too many requests or bulk not working

# Differences VS Python integration
- no mandatory constructor options, all optional with defaults
- automatic database and container creation with default settings
- support for managed identity
- support filters for querying and deletion
- properly store and return document metadata
- configurable text, embedding and metadata fields
- optional vector retrieval during query (to save bandwidth)
- user agent suffix for tracking: langchainjs-azure-cosmosdb-nosql

## Limitations
- missing enableCrossPartitionQuery for queries (not in current beta SDK)
- issue when performing mass delete (429 too many requests)
  * batch implementation using SDK bulk delete not working (some items are consistently not deleted)
